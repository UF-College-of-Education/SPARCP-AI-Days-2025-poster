This project addresses the gap between evidence-based recommendations and clinical practice by developing the Standardized Patient Avatar for Reflective Communication Practice (SPARC), an AI-enabled training tool for clinicians. SPARC simulates patient encounters (in this case, HPV vaccination discussions) allowing clinicians to practice communication strategies and receive real-time feedback without the resource-intensive demands of live standardized patients. The system integrates 3D avatars, language models fine-tuned on clinician–patient dialogues, and a multi-agent AI architecture that ensures accuracy, safety, and consistency. By providing a scalable, asynchronous, and interactive training environment, SPARC has the potential to transform communication training across the cancer continuum. This pilot project will serve as proof of concept, positioning the team for future large-scale studies that advance patient-centered outcomes.
